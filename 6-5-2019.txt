Software Engineering
Most software is bad but it's everywhere and everything depends on it
Match the language to the problem you are dealing with
(R for statistics, for example)
You cannot handle the complexity of memory management
We can only hold about 7+/-2 things in mind at a time
Example of a problem: Mariner 1 spacecraft used an instant value instead of an average value
This small error caused the entire spacecraft to be lost.
